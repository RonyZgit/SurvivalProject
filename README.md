# Survival Project

In this project, I analyzed survival data from a clinical study on Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC), a chronic liver disease. Our objective is to compare traditional survival models, such as the Cox Proportional Hazards model, with modern machine learning approaches, including Random Survival Forests and deep learning-based survival model (DeepHit). The dataset includes time-to-event information (death or liver transplant) and various clinical covariates for over 300 patients. Model performance by using standard metrics such as the Concordance Index (C-index) and Integrated Brier Score (IBS). 
Our analysis revealed that the treatment variable (D-penicillamine vs. placebo) did not have a significant impact on patient survival, aligning with clinical findings that questioned the drugâ€™s efficacy. Also, Random Survival Forests achieved the best overall performance, with the lowest Integrated Brier Score and the highest C-index, suggesting strong predictive ability and good calibration.

The analysis contains:
1. Explanatory data analysis including visualizations.
2. Survival models building:
  Cox Proportional Hazards model.
  Cumulative Incidence Function (CIF) for competing risks analysis.
  Random Survival Forests (RSF).
  Deep learning-based survival models.
3. Models analysis and comparisons.
4. Conclusions
